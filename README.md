# Modular Moodle Plugin Development Assistant (MoMoPDA)

This repository is a collection of prompts that can be combined in different ways in order to use agentic generative AI for software development in Moodle. Its first version is only tested with Claude Code, but with little modifications, it could be made work with other agent software and backends as well. Pull requests welcome!
